            <p>
                Tarts are very similar to pies but have a few distinct differences.
                For example, they’re often made in individual portions, and the pastry is slightly different.
                Pie pastry is typically flaky, whereas tart pastry is thicker and will hold its shape when you pick it up.

                Ice cream is possibly America’s favorite dessert. It’s sweet, creamy, and delicioulsy cold.
